# Physion-Studio

A physics sandbox for education, exploration, and creativity.

## Core Vision

Physion is an interactive, visual sandbox for teaching and learning physics
concepts. It lets educators and students place objects, **edit constants and
equations**, and see immediate physical consequences - bridging the gap between
theory and intuition.

## Features

- **Interactive Physics Simulation**: Real-time physics calculations with immediate visual feedback
- **Educational Focus**: Designed specifically for teaching and learning physics concepts
- **Visual Sandbox**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for placing and manipulating objects
- **Customizable Constants**: Adjust physics parameters on-the-fly to see their effects
- **Real-time Equation Editing**: Modify physics equations and see instant results
