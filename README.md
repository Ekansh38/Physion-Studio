# Physion-Studio

A physics sandbox for education, exploration, and creativity.

## Core Vision

Physion is an interactive, visual sandbox for teaching and learning physics
concepts. It lets educators and students place objects, **edit constants and
equations**, and see immediate physical consequences - bridging the gap between
theory and intuition.
